# Faster Development Cycles

Moving quickly in development isn’t just about releasing many features — it’s about making updates without impacting availability. Kubernetes supports this through tools built on key principles like:

- [Immutability](#immutability)
- [Declarative Configuration](#declarative-configuration)
- Self-healing systems
- Shared reusable libraries and tools

# Immutability
Containers and Kubernetes are built around the principle of immutability. Once an artifact—such as a container image—is created, it is not intended to be modified by users. Instead of applying incremental updates, a new image is built and deployed to replace the previous one. This approach offers the advantage of traceability: each change is tied to a specific image, making it easier to understand what led to a particular outcome. If something goes wrong, the system can simply roll back to a previous version. Immutable container images are a foundational concept in Kubernetes. Directly modifying a running container is considered an antipattern and should only be used as a last resort, typically in rare, time-critical production incidents where no other option is immediately viable.

# Declarative Configuration
In Kubernetes, configurations are defined declaratively by specifying the desired state of the system. Kubernetes then ensures the actual state aligns with this desired state automatically. Unlike imperative configuration—where each step must be manually defined and executed—declarative configs don’t need to be run to be understood, making them less error-prone. These configuration files can also be stored in version control, a practice known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This approach supports GitOps, where your infrastructure is managed through version-controlled source code, serving as the single source of truth for deployments. It also simplifies rollbacks, since previous configurations can be easily restored.
